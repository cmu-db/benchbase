# BenchBase Database Benchmarking Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical requirements and rationale for adopting BenchBase as our database benchmarking solution. Our evaluation focuses on three critical performance criteria: high-throughput transaction processing, complex multi-table transaction support, and dynamic workload scaling capabilities.

## Business Requirements

### 1. High-Performance Transaction Processing
**Requirement**: Support for high-throughput workloads up to **10,000 QPS (Queries Per Second)**

**Rationale**:
- Modern applications demand sub-second response times under heavy load
- Peak traffic scenarios require sustained high-throughput performance
- Database capacity planning requires accurate high-load testing
- Performance bottlenecks must be identified before production deployment

**Success Criteria**:
- Sustained 10K+ QPS without performance degradation
- Consistent latency under maximum load
- Resource utilization monitoring during peak throughput
- Scalable to future performance requirements

### 2. Complex Multi-Table Transaction Support
**Requirement**: Comprehensive testing of **multi-table transactional workloads**

**Rationale**:
- Real-world applications involve complex business logic spanning multiple tables
- ACID compliance verification across related data operations
- Foreign key constraint validation under concurrent access
- Cross-table consistency and integrity testing

**Success Criteria**:
- Support for TPC-C style multi-table transactions (5+ tables)
- Configurable transaction complexity and data relationships
- Deadlock detection and resolution testing
- Referential integrity validation under load

### 3. Dynamic Workload Scaling
**Requirement**: **Dynamic TPS adjustment** and adaptive load generation

**Rationale**:
- Production workloads exhibit variable traffic patterns
- Testing must simulate real-world load fluctuations
- Performance characteristics change under different load profiles
- Capacity planning requires understanding of dynamic scaling behavior

**Success Criteria**:
- Real-time TPS adjustment during test execution
- Configurable load patterns (spike, ramp-up, steady-state)
- Multiple workload profiles within single test run
- Performance monitoring across varying load conditions

## Technical Requirements

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Database Support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server compatibility
- **Configurable Workloads**: Standard benchmarks (TPC-C, TPC-H) with customization options
- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple terminal/worker support for parallel load generation
- **Isolation Levels**: Support for various transaction isolation levels
- **Monitoring & Metrics**: Comprehensive performance data collection and reporting

### Performance Specifications
| Metric | Requirement | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Peak TPS | 10,000+ QPS | Sustained for 5+ minutes |
| Latency | <50ms P99 | At maximum throughput |
| Concurrency | 100+ terminals | Simultaneous connections |
| Scalability | Linear scaling | Up to available hardware limits |

### Workload Characteristics
- **Transaction Types**: OLTP, mixed read/write, analytical queries
- **Data Distribution**: Configurable skew and hotspot patterns
- **Table Relationships**: Complex foreign key dependencies
- **Custom Schemas**: Support for application-specific table structures

## Why BenchBase Meets Our Requirements

### ✅ High TPS Capability
